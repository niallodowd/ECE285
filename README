Description 
===================================

Use small_56x56_celebs_300.npy file for demo. We have four different architectures, namely traditional AE, WGAN, VAE and CAE. Please find regarding 
files for demo purposes.

Requirements
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use Python 2 for demo. 

Install Packages:
pip install keras
pip install --user scikit-image
pip install Pillow

Disclaimer: Depending on your already installed packages, you may need some more packages. These were the ones we needed.
